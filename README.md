# Coursera_Algorithms_Part_I
Java Assignments from a Coursera course: <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI">Algorithms, Part I</a> (I recommend it) (June - July 2015)

I attended the course mainly for practicing my Java skills by solving assignements, but it's a nice intro to algorithms and data structures for those who need it.

I used the libraries stdlib.jar and algs4.jar by Princeton University (thanks!): http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/
